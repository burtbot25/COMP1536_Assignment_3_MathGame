# COMP1536_Assignment_3_MathGame

The third assignment for BCIT's COMP 1536 (Introduction to Web Development).

Students were tasked to create a log-in screen, a simple math game that generates a random question with a score tracker, a log-out button, then deploy the application on the web using Microsoft Azure.

In this assignment, I learned how to use PHP to accomplish the following:
  - Inject PHP into HTML5 pages
  - Understand how to pass information across multiple pages
  - Use the $_SESSION super global to store session variables
  - Use the $_POST super global to obtain and store user input from forms 
  - Use the $_GET super global to pass information through the URL header
  - Open and parse text from a text-file to verify the user's e-mail and password
  - Use PHP's isset(), is_numeric(), and empty() functions
  - Redirect the page using the header() function
  - Deploy a web application through Azure
